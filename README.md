# Mortgage Calculator

This is a simple Mortgage Calculator implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It calculates monthly payments, total payments, and total interest for a mortgage loan based on user inputs (loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and payments per year). The UI features a dark theme inspired by modern chat applications, with a clean design and minimal animations.
