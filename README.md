# Mortgage Calculator

This is a simple Mortgage Calculator implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It calculates monthly payments, total payments, and total interest for a mortgage loan based on user inputs (loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and payments per year). The UI features a dark theme inspired by modern chat applications, with a clean design and minimal animations.

## Files

The project is split into three files:
- `index.html`: The HTML structure for the calculator.
- `styles.css`: The CSS for styling with a dark theme.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript for calculations and input validation.
