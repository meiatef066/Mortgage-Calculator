# Mortgage Calculator

This is a simple Mortgage Calculator implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It calculates monthly payments, total payments, and total interest for a mortgage loan based on user inputs (loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and payments per year).
# Why Use a Mortgage Calculator?
- Estimate **monthly payments** based on loan amount, interest rate, term, and payments per year (usually 12 for monthly).
- See the **total payment** (all payments over the term).
- Calculate **total interest** (total payment minus the loan amount).

**Example**: For a $200,000 loan, 5% interest, 30-year term, and 12 payments per year:
- Monthly Payment: ~$1,073.64
- Total Payment: ~$386,511.57
- Total Interest: ~$186,511.57
